# CoLRev demo

The goal of this repository on GitHub codespaces is to demonstrate the CoLRev workflow. To use CoLRev for literature review projects (involving PDF documents), we recommend a local setup.

You can start using it by entering commands in the terminal below:

```

colrev init

colrev search --add colrev.semanticscholar
# select terms like "microsourcing"

colrev load

colrev status

```

TODO : sharing / collaboration instructions
Analyze changes in git version control (left)

retrieve microsourcing from semanticscholar (to see how records change when complemented by crossref?)
